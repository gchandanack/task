Krishna, one of the most beloved characters of the Hindu pantheon, has been portrayed in many lights: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, an exemplary ruler, and the Supreme Being. In The Complete Life of Krishna, Vanamali, a leading Krishna expert from a long line of prominent Krishna devotees, provides the first book in English or Sanskrit to cover the complete range of the avatar’s life.

Drawing from the Bhagavad Purana, the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata, and India’s sacred oral tradition, Vanamali shares stories from Krishna’s birth in a dungeon and early days as a merry trickster in Vrindavana, through his time as divine ruler at Dwaraka, to his final powerful acts as the hero Arjuna’s charioteer and guru in the Kurukshetra war. She explains how Krishna became a mahayogi, the greatest of all yogis, and attained complete mastery over himself and nature. By integrating the hero-child with the mahayogi, the playful lover with the divine ruler, Vanamali shows how the stories of Krishna’s life are expressed with such simplicity and humor that they enable anyone--man, woman, or child--to see the wisdom of his teachings.

This complete biography of the man who was also a god provides a valuable meditative tool allowing Krishna’s lessons to illuminate from within.

<p>KESARI
Hanuman was the son of Kesari, a vanar, and the grandson of Brihaspati, the king of Sumeru. His mother Anjana, was an apsara of the heavens and had descended to the earth as human, due to a curse. She and her husband had performed 12 years of penance and intense prayers due to which, Shiva granted them a child, as a boon. The child was Hanuman himself, due to which he is also interpreted as the reflection or shadow of Lord Shiva himself. Other mythological accounts often called Hanuman, as the son of The God of Wind, Vayu Dev, due to the popular story of the Wind God delivering a sacred pudding to Anjana, which originated from King Dasharatha’s ritual of Putrakama Yagya. The same pudding was had by the three wives of King Dasharatha, leading to the birth of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna. This pudding was delivered to her while performing her prayers to Shiva, who steered the Vayu God’s energy into the womb of Anjana. Hence, Hanuman is popularly known as Vayuputra.
